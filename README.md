# notetaker

This notetaker app was created so a user could have a place to write notes, save them, and keep them organized. After clicking the get started button, the user can type out a note they want, and once they are finished they can click the save file icon on the top right. If the user thinks the note is no longer neccessary, they can click the red x button next to their note on the left and get rid of the note.
